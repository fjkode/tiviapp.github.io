# [Jackal](http://jackal.surge.sh)

Watch live TV channels from across the globe with your friends and family...

We use open source data provided by [IPTV](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) and truncate explicit data so you can stream and watch channels with general purpose content.

## Features

- Jackal is built using NextJS and React
- It uses React Icons for web icons
- It uses React player to handle player related code
- Hosted on Surge so we can leverage HTTP based deployment service for seamless live streams

## Addons

- Please use Google Chrome browser using PC/Laptop to cast live streams to your TV via Chromecast

## Note

- Some live streams use HTTP packet (in order to view them, use this URL: [http://jackal.surge.sh](http://jackal.surge.sh)). For example, under Vietnam list, channel number 1 uses HTTP.

## Issues

- Please open any issues or bugs you notice [here](https://github.com/tpkahlon/jackal/issues)
- If you notice any live stream is broken, please copy the URL for the concerned stream, test it [here](https://hls-js.netlify.app/demo/?utm_source=cdnjs&utm_medium=cdnjs_link&utm_campaign=cdnjs_library)
- If it does not load, please flag the stream at [IPTV](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues) issues section.
