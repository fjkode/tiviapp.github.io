# Jackal

Watch live TV channels from across the globe with your friends and family...

We use open source data provided by [IPTV](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) and truncate explicit data so you can stream and watch channels with general purpose content.

## Features

- Jackal is built using NextJS and React
- It uses React Bootstrap for styling
- It uses React Icons for web icons
- It uses React player to handle player related code
- Hosted on Surge so we can leverage HTTP based deployment service for seamless live streams

## Addons

- Please use Google Chrome browser using PC/Laptop to cast live streams to your TV via Chromecast

## Issues
