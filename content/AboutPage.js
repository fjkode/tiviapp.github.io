        If you have a Chromecast, cast any stream to your TV by using Chromium

          infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by
          sending a pull request or opening an issue. However, note that we have
          no control over the destination of the link, and just removing the
          link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note
          that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is
          made on the site providing the link, and thus this is not a valid
          reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from
