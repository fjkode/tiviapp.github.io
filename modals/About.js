              Orange text means stream comes from a server that uses HTTP
              protocol and green text means stream uses HTTPS protocol.

            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> For desktop/laptop users, make sure you
              load site with http protocol instead of https protocol to view
              streams. For example, under Vietnam, channel no. 1 (ANTV) stream
              will work if you load the page{" "}
              <a href="http://jackal.surge.sh">

            that we have no control over the destination of the link, and just
            removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents
            from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright
