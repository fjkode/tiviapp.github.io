            We use localStorage API to store data received from IPTV, in your
            browser. If you want to remove the local data, please click
            "Refresh" button below. This step is done to make sure site loads

              Inside ID column, orange box means stream comes from a server that
              uses HTTP protocol and green box means stream uses HTTPS protocol.

            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> For desktop/laptop users, make sure you
              load site with http protocol instead of https protocol to view
              streams. For example, under Vietnam, channel no. 1 (ANTV) stream
              will work if you load the page{" "}
              <a href="http://jackal.surge.sh">

              works on iPhone/iOS devices or VLC.

            that we have no control over the destination of the link, and just
            removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents
            from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright
            because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus
